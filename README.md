# Week2_mini_prj_yw - Analysis Boston weather from 2013 to 2023

- A data anaylsis for the Boston weather from 2013 to 2023 dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaroopmeher/boston-weather-2013-2023/data)
- Import data by Pandas, inspecting, filter, grouping, visulizing and exploring with a simple ML algorithm. 

## Goal
The goal of this data anaylsis is compare the 10 years Boston weather from 2013 to 2023, and try to predict the future weather. After group the data with each month, then filter the winter monthes which from 2013 to 2023 to compare the differences of all weather data. To indicate of the trend of winter. Use linear regression model on the whole data to predict future temperature. The scatter plot have the red dot as the predition temperature, and blue is the real tempearture. X aixs is Wind speed and Y axis is temperature.  


## This dataset contains the following columns:
- time: The date in string format
- tavg: The average air temperature in Celsius, as a float
- tmin: The minimum air temperature in Celsius, as a float
- tmax: The maximum air temperature in Celsius, as a float
- prcp: The daily precipitation total in millimeters, as a float
- wdir: The average wind direction in degrees, as a float
- wspd: The average wind speed in kilometers per hour, as a float
- pres: The average sea-level air pressure in hectopascals, as a float
